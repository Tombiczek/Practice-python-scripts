# My simple python scripts
These are some simple python scripts written as practice during 
this year

# Cows and bulls
My first script written using OOP in python.
It is a very simple program imitating cows and bulls game.
I used some of this code while writing my MasterMind Java project.

moderate and strong). 

[Please don't use this script for real password generating]
